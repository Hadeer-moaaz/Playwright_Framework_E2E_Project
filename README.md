# OrangeHRM End-to-End Testing Framework

An end-to-end testing framework for the OrangeHRM application, built with **Playwright, TypeScript, and Cucumber BDD**. The project includes a working OrangeHRM Time module flow and demonstrates maintainable automation practices, reusable page objects, readable Gherkin scenarios, and a repeatable debugging workflow for real-world UI drift.

## Project Goals

- Validate key OrangeHRM user journeys, including authentication, employee management, and the Timesheet workflow.
- Use Cucumber and Gherkin to express behavior in a form that is readable by technical and non-technical team members.
- Build a maintainable Playwright framework with TypeScript, page objects, shared test support, and reusable step definitions.
- Adapt automation to actual application behavior when the UI differs from assumptions, including conditional selectors and dynamic page states.
- Explore Playwright's tooling, including the Inspector, Trace Viewer, and Codegen for recording and generating test interactions.
- Use GitHub Copilot in VS Code, AI agents, and MCP servers to support test planning, framework development, and debugging.
- Run automated checks through GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps, with Docker-based CI execution as part of the containerization work.

## Technology

- TypeScript and Node.js
- Playwright Test
- Cucumber.js with Gherkin BDD
- GitHub Actions
- Azure DevOps Pipelines
- Docker (CI containerization in progress)
- GitHub Copilot, AI agents, and MCP servers in VS Code

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS recommended)
- npm
- Git

### Install

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
npm ci
npx playwright install --with-deps
```

The tests target the public OrangeHRM demo application. Demo data is shared and may change, so tests that create records should use unique values and clean up when possible.

## Running Tests

Run the full Cucumber BDD suite:

```bash
npm run test:bdd
```

Run the Time-sheet scenario by tag:

```bash
npx cucumber-js --tags "@Regression2" --retry 1 --exit --format progress
```

Run the tagged regression/smoke/sanity scripts:

```bash
npm run cucumberRegression
npm run cucumberSmoke
npm run cucumberSanity
```

Run the Playwright Test suite:

```bash
npm run test:playwright
```
Cucumber reports are written to `reports/cucumber-report.html` when using the default Cucumber configuration. The tagged npm scripts generate `cucumber-report.html` in the repository root. Playwright is configured to collect traces on the first retry and retain screenshots and videos for failures.



## Current Status

The project is in a working state for the verified Timesheet scenario. The implementation has been adjusted to match the actual OrangeHRM UI behavior rather than assuming static selectors and immutable date fields. The successful flow covers:

- Logging in with valid credentials.
- Opening the Time module.
- Viewing a timesheet record.
- Editing the record and handling conditional project/activity selectors.
- Filling the required row data.
- Saving and validating the submitted status.

This is a good baseline for extending the project with additional OrangeHRM journeys and additional BDD coverage.

## Playwright Tooling

The framework uses Playwright's developer tools to make authoring and diagnosis more effective:

- **Inspector**: inspect pages and locators while debugging test interactions.
- **Trace Viewer**: review recorded actions, snapshots, and diagnostics for failed or retried tests.
- **Codegen (record and playback)**: record browser actions and generate a starting point for Playwright code.

These tools assist test development; generated code should be reviewed and adapted to the framework's page-object and BDD conventions.

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflows are defined in `.github/workflows/`. The Cucumber workflow runs regression, smoke, and sanity jobs on pushes and pull requests targeting `main` or `master`, then uploads the generated reports as artifacts. The Playwright workflow can be started manually from the Actions tab and uploads its HTML report.

The GitHub repository is also linked to Azure DevOps, where a pipeline is configured to use YAML from the repository. Docker-based test execution is part of the CI/CD containerization work; the current GitHub Actions workflows use GitHub-hosted Ubuntu runners directly.

## Test Coverage

Current BDD scenarios focus on:

- Login success, invalid credentials, and required-field validation.
- Searching for existing and non-existing employees in the PIM Employee List.
- Creating an employee and checking that the employee appears in search results.
- Editing and saving a Timesheet record through the actual OrangeHRM Time module UI.

See [the OrangeHRM test plan](specs/orangehrm-test-plan.md) for broader planned coverage.

## Reports and Artifacts

- Cucumber HTML report: `reports/cucumber-report.html` for the default configuration.
- Playwright HTML report: generated by the configured Playwright HTML reporter.
- GitHub Actions uploads test reports as workflow artifacts for later review.

## Contributions

When adding coverage, keep scenarios focused on observable behavior, use descriptive Gherkin, reuse page objects and shared support, and avoid relying on mutable demo data where unique test data can be used instead.
